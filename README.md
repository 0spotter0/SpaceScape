# SpaceScape

[Download latest release](https://github.com/0spotter0/spacegame/releases/latest)

Spacescape is a retro, arcade-style, space themed two-player game with the goal of being the last man standing.

Rules:
1. Each player starts with 3 lives
2. When a player is shot by a another player, the player loses a life.
3. If the players crash into each other, both players lose a life.
4. Last player standing wins. There will be a tie if both players end with 0 lives at the same time, in the case of a mutual collision when both players have 1 life remaining.

This project is made for the DandyHacks hackathon at https://devpost.com/software/spacescape
