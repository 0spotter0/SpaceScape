# Spacescape
Spacescape is a retro, arcade-style, space themed multiplayer game with the goal of being the last man standing.

rules:
1. Each player has 3 lives to start with
2. When a player is shot by a bullet coming from another player, the player loses a life.
3. If the players crash into each other, both player loses a life.
4. The player that still has lives remaining after one player dies, wins. The game is a tie if both players end with 0 lives at the same time, in the case of a mutual collision when both players have 1 life remaining.

This project is made for the DandyHacks hackathon at https://devpost.com/software/spacescape
